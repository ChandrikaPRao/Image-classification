# Image-classification
CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. The images are full-color RGB, but they are fairly small, only 32 x 32. Developed a classification model with the CIFAR10 dataset using Keras.
